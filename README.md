# YTUHD

Unlocks 1440p (2K) and 2160p (4K) resolutions in iOS YouTube app.
- The reason I created this repo because the latest version of YTUHD required libundirect and there are some problems with Cydiasubstrate.framework that doesn't work with YTUHD.
- I removed the auto reload video thing because sometimes the video is actually loading but YTUHD just keeps reloading nonstop.
- Maybe this repo might help you! You can build this using "make package FINALPACKAGE=1".
