# YTUHD

Unlocks 1440p (2K) and 2160p (4K) resolutions in iOS YouTube app.
This requried at least iOS 14 and recommend at least A12 chip for the best 2K and 4K experience.
## Known issues
Sometimes the video will stuck so I'm finding a solution for this.

- The reason I created this repo because the latest version of YTUHD required libundirect and there are some problems with Cydiasubstrate.framework that doesn't work with YTUHD.
- I remove the auto reload logic and update some A/B settings from PoomSmart so now 2K and 4K videos should playing fine.
- Maybe this repo might help you! If you find any bug,you can open a new issue or make a PR to here.
