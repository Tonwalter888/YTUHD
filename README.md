# YTUHD

Unlocks 1440p (2K) and 2160p (4K) resolutions in iOS YouTube app.
- The reason I created this repo because the latest version of YTUHD required libundirect and there are some problems with Cydiasubstrate.framework that doesn't work with YTUHD.
- I fix some 2K/4K buffering bugs so now it should working fine.
- Maybe this repo might help you! If you find any bug,you can open a new issue or make a PR to here.
