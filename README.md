# YTUHD

Unlocks 1440p (2K) and 2160p (4K) resolutions in iOS YouTube app.
This requried at least iOS 11 and recommend at least A12 chip for the best 2K and 4K experience.

- The reason I created this repo because the latest version of YTUHD have some problems with the logic itself that can't unlock 4K if you're sideloading.
- And in main YTUHD repo,PoomSmart try to make 2K and 4K work in older devices (older than A12 chip) but some logic don't work with sideloading. (Even he tries his best.)
- Plus my main point is to make 2K and 4K work in A12 chip and newer,so I created this repo to solve this.
- I removed auto reload logic,fixed All VP9 not working,fixed settings crashes and updated some codes from PoomSmart so now 2K and 4K videos should playing fine.
- Maybe this repo might help you! If you find any bugs,you can open a new issue or make a PR to here.
