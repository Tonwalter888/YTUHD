# YTUHD

Unlocks 1440p (2K) and 2160p (4K) resolutions in iOS YouTube app.
The reason I created this repo because the latest version of YTUHD required libundirect.
And there's some problems with Cydiasubstrade.framwork that don't work with YTUHD now.
I removed the auto reload thing because sometimes the video actually loading but YTUHD just reload looping nonstop.
Maybe this repo might help you! You can build using "make package".
