# YTUHD

Unlocks 1440p (2K) and 2160p (4K) resolutions in iOS YouTube app.
- The reason I created this repo because the latest version of YTUHD required libundirect and there are some problems with Cydiasubstrate.framework that doesn't work with YTUHD.
- I set the auto reload video thing to wait time buffers from 2 seconds to 3 seconds and I NEED to disable HDR due to some playback issues,I'm sorry if you want HDR video.
- Maybe this repo might help you! If you have better idea to fix this,you can PR to here.
