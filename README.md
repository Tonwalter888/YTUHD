# YTUHD

Unlocks 1440p (2K) and 2160p (4K) resolutions in iOS YouTube app.
- The reason I created this repo because the latest version of YTUHD required libundirect and there are some problems with Cydiasubstrate.framework that doesn't work with YTUHD.
- I set the auto reload video thing to wait time buffers from 2 seconds to 5 seconds to prevent YTUHD keeps reloading nonstop and to give more time for buffering try in videoes.
- Also I added the video time to revert 1 sec to make YouTube rebuffer videoes.
- Maybe this repo might help you! You can build this using "make package FINALPACKAGE=1".
