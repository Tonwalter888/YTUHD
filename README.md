# YTUHD

Unlocks 1440p (2K) and 2160p (4K) resolutions in iOS YouTube app.
- The reason I created this repo because the latest version of YTUHD required libundirect and there are some problems with Cydiasubstrate.framework that doesn't work with YTUHD.
- I add the new setting section called "Disable HDR" due to some playback issues for some users and fix some 2K/4K buffering bugs.
- Maybe this repo might help you! If you have better idea to fix this,you can PR to here.
