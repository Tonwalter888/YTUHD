# YTUHD

Unlocks 1440p (2K) and 2160p (4K) resolutions in iOS YouTube app.
- The reason I created this repo because the latest version of YTUHD required libundirect and there's some problems with Cydiasubstrate.framework that don't work with YTUHD now.
- I removed the auto reload video thing because sometimes the video is actually loading but YTUHD just keep reloading nonstop.
Maybe this repo might help you! You can build this using "make package FINALPACKAGE=1".
